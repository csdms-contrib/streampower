The programs in this supplement make use of routines from Numerical Recipes, 2nd edition, as well as the
standard C libraries stdlib, stdio, malloc, math. The beginning of each program includes several
"#include" statements that indicate the libraries that must be linked during compilation in order
for these programs to properly compile. Operating systems and compilers differ, so it is the responsbility 
of the user to properly link the codes in this supplement to the required libraries. Each code 
also has a "standalone" version in which the required Numerical Recipes routines are included directly
in the source code. In these standalone versions, the standard C libaries are still required but linkage 
to the Numerical Recipes libraries is not. The user should validate the output of any code before proceeding 
to use the code in their work. No guarantee is expressed or implied regarding the accuracy of these programs.
